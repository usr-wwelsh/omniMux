A self-hosted music server that lets you search YouTube, cache tracks to your library, and stream everything through a Spotify-like PWA. Built on top of [Navidrome](https://www.navidrome.org/) with a FastAPI middleware layer and a SvelteKit frontend.

> **Your music. Your server. No middlemen.**

**[Live demo → omnimux.wwel.sh](https://omnimux.wwel.sh)** (guest access, read-only library)

## Why omniMux?

Streaming services rent you access to music you'll never own, lock your library behind monthly fees, and vanish the moment licensing deals fall through. omniMux flips that: search YouTube, keep the files on your own hardware, and stream them from anywhere over a PWA you install once. No cloud. No subscription. No gatekeepers. Just your music, on your server.

## Quick start

<div style="border-left: 4px solid #1982C4; padding: 12px 16px; margin: 16px 0; background: #0d1117;">

**Prerequisites:** Docker and Docker Compose.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/usr-wwelsh/omnimux.git
cd omniMux
```

Edit `docker-compose.yml` and set a real value for `JWT_SECRET`, then:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

| Service | URL |
|---|---|
| Web app | http://localhost:8801 |
| API | http://localhost:8800 |
| Navidrome | http://localhost:4533 |

On first run, open Navidrome at `:4533`, create an admin account, then log into the omniMux web app with those same credentials.

<details>
<summary><strong>Configuration</strong></summary>

All configuration is via environment variables in `docker-compose.yml`:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `NAVIDROME_URL` | `http://navidrome:4533` | Internal URL of the Navidrome service |
| `MUSIC_DIR` | `/music` | Where downloaded audio files are stored |
| `DATA_DIR` | `/data` | Where the SQLite database is stored |
| `JWT_SECRET` | `change-me-in-production` | Secret used to sign auth tokens — **change this** |

## FAQ

**Why the heck an AutoDJ?**
Real DJs are great — but who doesn't want a personal robot DJ running on their own hardware? AutoDJ analyses every track for BPM, key, mood, and energy using deterministic DSP (no AI, no cloud), then crossfades between them with beat-locked transitions. It's just math, and it slaps.

**Why YouTube?**
It's the largest music catalogue on the planet and the only one without a paywall. Topic channels are officially uploaded by labels and provide near-CD-quality audio for most releases.

**Can I use my existing music library?**
Yes — drop your files into the `MUSIC_DIR` volume and Navidrome will scan them. omniMux treats YouTube as an *augmentation* to your library, not a replacement.

**Does it work on iOS?**
Yes, via the PWA. Safari → Share → Add to Home Screen. Requires HTTPS, so expose it through a reverse proxy or a Cloudflare Tunnel.

**Why not just use Spotify?**
Because you don't own anything on Spotify. The day they drop a track, raise prices, or go under, your library is gone. omniMux tracks live as files on your disk.
